File Poller: Send the data from the csv file to a topic (Publisher Component) using docker-compose file Kafka
Here's a breakdown of the components and flow involved:

File Poller:

This is a service within your Docker Compose setup.
It will continuously monitor a specified  csv file for changes (new data, modifications).
When it detects changes, it will read the new/modified data from the csv file.
Publisher Component:

This is another service in your Docker Compose setup.
It is responsible for communicating with Kafka.
It will receive the data from the File Poller.
It will then publish this data to a specific Kafka topic.
Kafka:

This is a distributed streaming platform.
It acts as a central message broker.
It will store the data published to the topic in a durable and scalable manner.
Other services or applications can then subscribe to this topic to consume the data.
Docker Compose:

This is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
use a docker-compose.yml file to configure the File Poller, Publisher Component, and Kafka services.
It will handle the networking and orchestration between these containers.
Overall Flow:

The File Poller container monitors a file.
When changes are detected in csv file, it reads the new data.
The File Poller sends the data to the Publisher Component container.
The Publisher Component connects to the Kafka container.
The Publisher Component publishes the data to a Kafka topic.
display the consumer data .  ..this is the  csv file path "C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\task_6\data\employee_data.csv"   give me the end to end code with project structure.






how to run this project from scratch

docker-compose up --build 
## Confirm that the file-poller is sending messages to Kafka and that the publisher is consuming these messages.

docker-compose logs -f file-poller publisher kafka mysql       

 Edit the employee_data.csv file in the data/ directory

docker-compose exec kafka kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --topic employee-data --from-beginning
## his command will consume and display all messages from the employee-data topic from the beginning. You should see the data from employee_data.csv appearing here.

docker-compose exec mysql mysql -uroot -p12345678@Lrs -h localhost -P 3307 employee_kafka_db
## verify that the publisher service is successfully inserting data into the MySQL database:

SELECT * FROM kafka_emp;  ## display all the records here that are inserted in kafka topic






iam aiming  to build a robust and scalable data pipeline that facilitates the flow of employee data from a CSV file to a REST API, leveraging Kafka and MySQL as intermediate components as from the same above project.
CSV File:
The source of employee data, potentially updated periodically.
File Poller Service (file-poller):
Monitors the CSV file for changes.
When changes are detected, it extracts new or updated rows.
Publishes these rows as JSON-encoded messages to a Kafka topic (e.g., employee-data).
Kafka
Acts as a distributed streaming platform.
The employee-data topic stores the messages published by the file poller.
Publisher Service (publisher):
Consumes messages from the Kafka employee-data topic.
For each message:
Extracts relevant data .
Calls a stored procedure in the MySQL database, passing the extracted data as parameters.
Retrieves the result set from the stored procedure.
Formats the result set into JSON.
Makes an HTTP POST request to the REST API, including the formatted data in the request body.
Handles the API response appropriately (error handling, logging, etc.).
MySQL Database:
Stores employee-related data.
Houses the stored procedure that performs data retrieval or transformation based on input from Kafka messages.
REST API:
The external system that receives the employee data from the publisher service.
It might perform further processing, storage, or integration with other systems.
Implementation
Docker Compose (docker-compose.yml)
Defines the services: zookeeper, kafka, mysql, file-poller, and publisher.
Configures environment variables, port mappings, volumes, and dependencies between services.
The system is designed to be modular, scalable, and flexible, leveraging Docker and microservices architecture.
File Poller Service (file_poller.py)
Implements the logic to monitor the CSV file, extract data, and publish to Kafka.
Publisher Service (publisher.py)
Contains the code to consume from Kafka, call the stored procedure, format the result set, and send data to the REST API.
MySQL Database:
Create the necessary database and tables.
Define the stored procedure to handle data retrieval/transformation.
Key Considerations:
Key considerations include error handling, data validation, logging, security, api authentication.   now update the full code incorporating everything mentioned in this prompt in the project without skipping anything in the project code.
